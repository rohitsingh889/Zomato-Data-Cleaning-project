Given the price i had to pay for this food (324 rupees for ONE biryani) they could have done much better than what i got. The biryani was dry. Medium flavoured. The rice was not frangrant.\\n\\nI was asked to choose one among - Mint chutney or gravy. I needed to pay more if i wanted both !.. Even a place that would give 80 rupee biryani provides both of this accomplaints.\\n\\nThe packaging was good but only half of the box was biryani. Other half was chutney and jamoon.

In this meal, u will get paneer gravy, Plain dal, White rice, 3 phulkas, curd, pickle, onions and 1 pakoda. To begin with, I will say the phulkas were soft and nice. It goes well with both the gravies. Dal was watery though!! Rice also goes well with both the gravy's, but it tastes better with Paneer gravy. Paneer pieces were not soft. It was a little hard. Curd tasted nice! Instead of pakoda, they cud have given some small dessert like jamun or kheer etc. Nevertheless, it was average fare for the night. Don't have complaints though.
