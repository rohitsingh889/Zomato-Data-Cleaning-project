## Data Cleaning Tasks
The following steps are performed in this project:

1. **Deleting redundant columns** – Remove unnecessary columns that do not contribute to analysis.  
2. **Renaming columns** – Standardize column names for consistency and readability.  
3. **Dropping duplicates** – Remove duplicate rows to ensure each record is unique.  
4. **Cleaning individual columns** – Strip whitespace, fix formatting issues, and standardize text and numeric entries.  
5. **Handling missing values** – Remove or impute NaN values where necessary.  
6. **Data type conversions** – Ensure correct types for numerical and categorical columns.  
7. **Standardizing categorical values** – Normalize text entries for categorical columns (e.g., cuisines, location).  
8. **Outlier detection and treatment** – Handle extreme values in numerical columns like cost and ratings.  
9. **Additional transformations** – Further modifications to make the dataset ready for analysis.  
10. **Validation and sanity checks** – Ensure consistency, correctness, and completeness of the dataset.  

**And much more:** Removing special characters, trimming text fields, merging similar categories, and preparing the dataset for future analytics.

This project is part of my portfolio, demonstrating practical Python and pandas skills applied to a real-world dataset from Zomato. It showcases essential data cleaning techniques, including:

Handling missing values and NaNs

Removing duplicates and redundant columns

Renaming and standardizing column names

Cleaning and transforming text and numerical data

Preparing the dataset for analysis and further processing

This work reflects the kind of data wrangling and preprocessing expertise that is crucial for data analyst, data engineer, and business intelligence roles.
